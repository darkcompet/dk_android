 * When you have a big amount of data to cache, this will store it in memory first

 * store in memory since MLU, this will store them into internal storage via DiskLruCache.
 * <p>
 * Note that, each data (inside snapshot) will have own priority to be kept in memory. Lower
 * priority will be popped and stored into disk when MLU happen.
